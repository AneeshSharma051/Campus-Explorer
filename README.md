An Application For Navigation in PSIT Campus

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Navigating through college blocks can be difficult and time-consuming, especially for newcomers. The lack of indoor physical maps adds to the problem, leading to confusion and wasted time. Our Android app aims to simplify the navigation process by providing users with a image-based path that leads from their source to the destination room within a college block.

ABSTRACT:

This project aims to develop an Android app that provides indoor navigation in one of our college's blocks using images. The app will allow users to select their source and destination rooms on a map of the block, and it will generate a image-based path that leads from the source to the destination. The app will be developed for Android smartphones and will use Java programming language. The app will be user-friendly and will provide accurate directions, reducing the time and effort required to find one's way between different rooms and buildings.
